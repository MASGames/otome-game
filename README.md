# otome-game
An otome game created by us.

## Developer setup

0) Get a local copy of the code on your machine by opening up a command prompt and executing the 
    following command in the root directory you want the code to be written to (e.g. if you want the 
    code to be in 'C:\GitHub\otome-game', execute the command from 'C:\GitHub'): 

    `git clone https://github.com/MASGames/otome-game.git` 

    Note: I also recommend installing [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) as a convenient UI for most source control interactions. 

1) Download [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/latest.html) and follow the [installation instructions](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/quickstart.html#the-ren-py-launcher)

2) Run the Ren'py Launcher and, under Preferences, update your Projects Directory to the parent directory
    to where you downloaded the code. (E.g. in the above example, 'C:\GitHub'.) After this step, the main
    page in the Ren'Py Launcher should show 'otome-game' as one of the choices to launch.

## Running the game 

1) Select 'Launch Project' to run the game!

## Making changes

1) Select a file under the 'Edit File' menu such as 'script.rpy'. This may prompt you to install an 
    editor (the Ren'Py website recommends Editra) if you haven't already. 

2) Alternately, you can load the files directly in your preferred editor.
