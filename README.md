# otome-game
An otome game created by us.

## Developer setup

0) Get a local copy of the code on your machine by opening up a command prompt and executing the following command in the root directory you want the code to be written to (e.g. if you want the code to be in 'C:\GitHub\otome-game', execute the command from 'C:\GitHub'): 

`git clone https://github.com/MASGames/otome-game.git` 

1) Download [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/latest.html) and follow the [installation instructions](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/quickstart.html#the-ren-py-launcher)

2) Run the Ren'py Launcher and, under Preferences, update your Projects Directory to the parent directory to where you downloaded the code. (E.g. in the above example, 'C:\GitHub'.) After this step, the main page in the Ren'Py Launcher should show 'otome-game' as one of the choices to launch.

After having selected the 'otome-game' project, you can: 

3a) Select 'Launch Project' to run the game!

3b) Select a file under the 'Edit File' menu such as 'script.rpy'. This may prompt you to install an editor (the Ren'Py website recommends Editra) if you haven't already.
