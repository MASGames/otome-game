# otome-game
An otome game created by us.

## Developer setup

1) Download [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/latest.html) and follow the [installation instructions](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/quickstart.html#the-ren-py-launcher)

2) I recommend installing [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) as a convenient UI for 
    interacting with Git. It will ask you to sign in with your GitHub credentials.

    After installing, go to File -> Clone Repository. It should already provide you with a list of repositories you own -- select "MASGames/otome-game", and set the local location to wherever you've set Ren'Py to look for projects.  

## Making changes

1) In the Ren'Py Launcher, select the 'otome-game' project, and then select a file under the 'Edit File'
    menu such as 'script.rpy'. This should prompt you to install an editor (the Ren'Py website recommends 
    Editra) if you haven't already. 

2) Alternately, you can load the files directly in your preferred editor. 

## Running the game 

1) From the Ren'Py Launcher, select the 'otome-game' project and then select 'Launch Project'!
