   ### LIAM'S ROUTE: MONTH FOUR BEGINS ###
 
   # Scene 4.1 First study session with Liam as they work on the project

   "Olly is sleeping in a spot of sun, his tail curled up to his snout. I look down at my paper to see what ideas I have written down."
   
   "Two, three of them might be usable. Other than that, my small doodle of a pigeon sitting on a pumpkin isn't going to be much help."
   
   "I stretch my arms and look around. This particular library, Augury's Atrium, is reasonably full of other students."
   
   "Though there is some amount of chatter, the sounds are softened by the high ceiling and soft plush carpets."
   
   "If I listen closely, I can even hear the soft cooing and chirping of the birds that traditionally nest at the top of this library."
   
   "The school has been maintaining the nesting boxes for the birds since this library had been built, I heard."
   
   "That the singing of those birds relaxes many of the students studying here had just been an unintended, but happy side effect."
   
   l "Viola!"
   
   show l happy
   
   v "Over here!"
   
   "I move aside my bag from the chair next to me, and Liam slides in."
   
   hide l
   
   l "Sorry about being late! There was just some clean up at the health center, and I had to run back to the dorm to get my things--"
   
   v "You don't have to apologize for that, Liam. I'm glad you got here."
   
   "Liam smiles, and runs his hand over the side of his head, flattening some tufts of hair that had gotten messed up from his run here."
   
   "I am glad. If I had to pick someone to be assigned with for a project, Liam would have been my first choice too."
   
   v "I did get some books we might want to use, but it might be better to talk together first?"
   
   v "Actually, I did want to ask. Can you tell me more about your major, Healing? I know some of the concepts, but it's a different beast than having experience with it."
   
   "Liam taps one of his hands against a book, and tips his head back."
   
   l "Right. You already know what Healing can't do?"
   
   v "Reverse death. Replace an irrevocably damaged organ. Permanently change the body's structure."
   
   #note later on will include something about healing and the emotion-based side 
   
   l "Yes. While Healing can speed up things that a body can already do, like the skin covering up a cut, or mending bone, there are limits."
   
   l "Healing...gives things a push. But it can't make the body do the impossible, like regrow a lost hand."
   
   v "Hmm. Is there a reason that most Healers start off working on familiars first?"
   
   "From Liam's phone, Clara has gotten herself out, and has started poking Olly's head with her paw."
   
   l "There is. First, studying how magic flows through all kinds of familiars helps give us the broader eye we need for patients later on."
   
   l "Second. Familiars, just from the way they store magic, tend to be a little more durable than humans are."
   
   l "So, it's safer I suppose, for us to start with familiars while in training."
   
   "Olly, who had been napping, has started making grumbling sounds, and peeks open an eye at Clara."
   
   l "There's a lot more I need to study before we are allowed to even look at any human patients."
   
   v "Like what? Botany & Beasts, I suppose--and--"
   
   l "Summoning, yes. And Cursebreaking. Though in that area, I would bow to your expertise."
   
   "Olly jumps up, and snaps, teasingly, at Clara's paw without touching it." 
   
   "Clara jumps back, and bats a crumpled piece of paper at Olly." 
   
   "Olly whacks it back with his tail, and with a tiny hiss, retreats to sit in one of my jacket pockets."
   
   o "I was sleeping!"
   
   "Liam strokes down Clara's ears, and whispers something to her. Clara nods, and dissolves back into the phone."
   
   v "Shush, Olly. Look, you can nap now. Clara will wait til later and you two can play then."
   
   "Olly nods, slightly sulky, and settles down."
   
   v "All right. I think I got the bare bones explanation down. So what does Healing feel like, when you do it?"
   
   l "Hmm. It's like..."
   
   l "Imagine a mosaic. With a hundred--no, a thousand pieces, in all kinds of colors."
   
   l "Imagine that same mosaic with all its pieces scattered."
   
   l "In some areas of the mosaic, it's fine if one or two pieces are missing."
   
   l "In some areas, without the key pieces, the whole picture is lost."
   
   l "And you try to gather up those thousands of pieces, and put them back together. In the dark."
   
   l "I think...that's what it's like. Though I haven't worked on any really difficult cases yet."
   
   v "Wow. Something like that--"
   
   "I can see it in my mind's eye, the glass pieces scattering, jewel-bright ruby and sapphire and gold, and a careful hand trying to delicately place them, one by one, back together, without cutting their fingers on any of the sharp edges."
   
   l "Viola? Did that make sense? Or did I ramble for too long--?"
   
   v "No, no. You explained it very well."
   
   l "I'm glad I haven't lectured you into a nap like Olly. What are you doing with Cursebreaking now?"
   
   "We spend the rest of the hour discussing our most recent assignments and Liam's health center work."
   
   "While didn't land on a project idea yet when we left the library, I'm sure we'll get to one soon by our next meeting."

   "It's been a week. In between the rest of my classes, I've been doing my best to finish the books Liam and I had checked out last time."
   
   "We still haven't hit on a project idea yet. But what information I have managed to read has been fascinating."
   
   #will include 2 or 3 examples of magical worldbuilding in that above sentence later. 
   
   show l normal
   
   l "This is a little more difficult than I expected."
   
   v "Yeah. I'm sorry. If I could only brainstorm on this faster, then we would be able to work on it sooner."
   
   l "Hey. What do you mean, if only you could think faster? I thought I was your project partner too."
   
   v "Oh! No, that's not what I meant. I know you are. It's just..."

   "I bite my lip. Liam's eyes have dark circles under them now, most days than not."
   
   "In between studying for his Healing classes, and his part time work at the health center, I know he has to deal with his own stress too."
   
   "I think I would just feel better if I could take on more of a lead on the responsibilities for the project. Give him less to worry about."
   
   Student 1 "Ashmark?"
   
   "I turn my head. It's another student, who just stopped by our table. They look vaguely familiar."
   
   "A classmate in Cursebreaking 101, I think. They sit...somewhere far behind me, so I haven't had the chance to talk to them much."
   
   v "Yes?"
   
   Student "Is that book you're holding 'Corinne's Cursebreaking Cases: Volume 1'?"
   
   v "Yes. I'm not done with it though. Sorry, in case you were thinking of borrowing it."
   
   Student "Oh. Nothing for it then. What's with those other books then? I didn't think we had a Healing portion on our next test."
   
   v "We don't. Liam here helped pick those out. We have a project that has something to do with Healing and Cursebreaking, after all."
   
   "The student's face, which up til this moment had been friendly, goes a little cold."
   
   Student "Ah, Healing? That shouldn't be the hardest part of your project then."
   
   l "Healing, as a major, has a lot of branches and subfields going on. It's a bit more complicated than most people think."
   
   Student "Please. Looking after sickly people or someone else's familiar--it's not really a dangerous field, is it?"
   
   Student "Sometimes it sounds pretty cushy to me, compared to Cursebreaking. Isn't that right, Ashmark?"
   
   "My hands clench. Who does this person think they are?" 
   
   "I remember Liam, softly whispering to me in the library about his Healing classes, his eyes bright and excited."
   
   "The careful way he looks after the familiars in the health center."
   
   "All the times he worried over small animals who were injured, or even me, after I scraped my knees from running in the gardens"
   
   "or got a bruise from falling off a tree." 
   
   "Even if I didn't cry, Liam would cry sometimes, when treating me when we were small."
   
   "He would be quiet, but there would always be two or three tears that slipped down his face when he put a bandage on me."
   
   "The other student is still waiting for my response, with a bit of a smirk on their face, like they're expecting me to laugh along with their joke."

   "I take in a breath. The other student is already being dismissive of Liam."
   
   "I'm angry, but I shouldn't ignore what Liam is thinking. I'll see how he wants to respond."
   
   "Though I had been standing up a second ago, I force myself to sit down, ignoring the other student's puzzled look."
   
   v "Liam? It's a little noisy here isn't it? Do you want to go somewhere else?"
   
   "Liam's blue eyes are wide, like he's surprised. Surprise and relief."
   
   "Did he think I was going to get into a fight?"
   
   "Well...there was that time when we were four and someone pushed Liam at the playground to get to the swings. I threw sand at them."
   
   "And that time when were six, and someone stepped on Liam's painted flowerpot in art class. On purpose. I'm pretty sure I kicked their knees out from under them."

   "But they didn't get hurt! Much."
   
   "And that time when we were ten and..."
   
   "Okay. He would have been right to be worried."
   
   v "If you're all right with staying here we can stay too."
   
   l "We'll stay."
   
   v "Okay. Sure."
   
   "I look up to see the other student still standing there. I make a slight wave with my hand, shooing them away."
   
   v "I think our conversation is done here."
   
   l "Wait."
    
   Student "What?"
   
   l "The next time you or your familiar, if you have one, falls ill..."
    
   l "Please bring them to a Healer. You may not think what we do is exciting, or even respect us."
   
   l "We will treat you anyways. Because that's what we do, when someone is in pain."

   Student "Hmmph. Thanks so much for the lecture. I gotta go to my next class."
   
   "I glare at the back of the student as they go all the way out to the exit of the library."
   
   "At least, until a hand pats the top of my head."
   
   v "Liam?"
   
   "His hand freezes. He looks at me, and draws his arm back to his side."
   
   l "Ah. Sorry. You were just glaring so fiercely at them. It was..."
   
   "He clears his throat."
   
   l "I'm just glad you wanted to defend me." 
   
   l "But more than that, I do appreciate that you asked how I wanted to handle it first."
   
   v "You love Healing. And you work hard at it."
   
   v "I thought you would be mad, about what they said."
   
   l "I am. But it's not unexpected."
   
   l "Healing isn't exactly a field of exciting derring-do, after all."
   
   l "And there are some who think that if a familiar is weak enough to get sick, then they'll simply move on to a stronger familiar."
   
   l "I...hate people who think like that."

   "Liam's serious when he says that, his lips turned down into a frown, his brows drawn together."
   
   "I don't know what else I can say, so I nudge him with my elbow."
   
   v "Should we take a break now? I heard there's a new snack stall near your dorms. I can treat you."
   
   l "Snacks before dinner? Getting a little rebellious are we, Miss Ashmark?"
   
   "His expression is lighter now. That suits him better."

   "I don't want to look at Liam's face, and see him sad."
   
   "I'm not sad though. The blood pounding through my veins indicates the opposite."
   
   v "Should we go outside?"
   
   "I'm already standing, my chair pushed back with a loud screech."
   
   Student "What for?"
   
   "The student doesn't sound as certain of themself, their expression more puzzled than patronizing."
   
   v "Come now. We're both Cursebreaking students. Are you scared of a friendly duel?"
   
   v "And if we are going to do this, I'd rather not accidentally destroy some of the valuable books in here."
