   "Olly is sleeping in a spot of sun, his tail curled up to his snout. I look down at my paper to see what ideas I have written down."
   
   "Two, three of them might be usable. Other than that, my small doodle of a pigeon sitting on a pumpkin isn't going to be much help."
   
   "I stretch my arms and look around. This particular library, Augury's Atrium, is reasonably full of other students."
   
   "Though there is some amount of chatter, the sounds are softened by the high ceiling and soft plush carpets."
   
   "If I listen closely, I can even hear the soft cooing and chirping of the birds that traditionally nest at the top of this library."
   
   "The school has been maintaining the nesting boxes for the birds since this library had been built, I heard."
   
   "That the singing of those birds relaxes many of the students studying here had just been an unintended, but happy side effect."
   
   l "Viola!"

   v "Over here!"
   
   "I move aside my bag from the chair next to me, and Liam slides in."

   l "Sorry about being late! There was just some clean up at the health center, and I had to run back to the dorm to get my things--"
   
   v "You don't have to apologize for that, Liam. I'm glad you got here."
   
   "Liam smiles, and runs his hand over the side of his head, flattening some tufts of hair that had gotten messed up from his run here."
   
   "I am glad. If I had to pick someone to be assigned with for a project, Liam would have been my first choice too."
   
   v "I did get some books we might want to use, but it might be better to talk together first?"
   
   v "Actually, I did want to ask. Can you tell me more about your major, Healing? I know some of the concepts, but it's a different beast than having experience with it."
   
   "Liam taps one of his hands against a book, and tips his head back."
   
   l "Right. You already know what Healing can't do?"
   
   v "Reverse death. Replace an irrevocably damaged organ. Permanently change the body's structure."
   
   #note later on will include something about healing and the emotion-based side 
   
   l "Yes. While Healing can speed up things that a body can already do, like the skin covering up a cut, or mending bone, there are limits."
   
   l "Healing...gives things a push. But it can't make the body do the impossible, like regrow a lost hand."
   
   v "Hmm. Is there a reason that most Healers start off working on familiars first?"
   
   "From Liam's phone, Clara has gotten herself out, and has started poking Olly's head with her paw."
   
   l "There is. First, studying how magic flows through all kinds of familiars helps give us the broader eye we need for patients later on."
   
   l "Second. Familiars, just from the way they store magic, tend to be a little more durable than humans are."
   
   l "So, it's safer I suppose, for us to start with familiars while in training."
   
   "Olly, who had been napping, has started making grumbling sounds, and peeks open an eye at Clara."
   
   l "There's a lot more I need to study before we are allowed to even look at any human patients."
   
   v "Like what? Botany & Beasts, I suppose--and--"
   
   l "Summoning, yes. And Cursebreaking. Though in that area, I would bow to your expertise."
   
   "Olly jumps up, and snaps, teasingly, at Clara's paw without touching it." 
   
   "Clara jumps back, and bats a crumpled piece of paper at Olly." 
   
   "Olly whacks it back with his tail, and with a tiny hiss, retreats to sit in one of my jacket pockets."
   
   o "I was sleeping!"
   
   "Liam strokes down Clara's ears, and whispers something to her. Clara nods, and dissolves back into the phone."
   
   v "Shush, Olly. Look, you can nap now. Clara will wait til later and you two can play then."
   
   "Olly nods, slightly sulky, and settles down."
   
   v "All right. I think I got the bare bones explanation down. So what does Healing feel like, when you do it?"
   
   l "Hmm. It's like..."
   
   l "Imagine a mosaic. With a hundred--no, a thousand pieces, in all kinds of colors."
   
   l "Imagine that same mosaic with all its pieces scattered."
   
   l "In some areas of the mosaic, it's fine if one or two pieces are missing."
   
   l "In some areas, without the key pieces, the whole picture is lost."
   
   l "And you try to gather up those thousands of pieces, and put them back together. In the dark."
   
   l "I think...that's what it's like. Though I haven't worked on any really difficult cases yet."
   
   v "Wow. Something like that--"
   
   "I can see it in my mind's eye, the glass pieces scattering, jewel-bright ruby and sapphire and gold, and a careful hand trying to delicately place them, one by one, back together, without cutting their fingers on any of the sharp edges."
   
   l "Viola? Did that make sense? Or did I ramble for too long--?"
   
   v "No, no. You explained it very well."
   
   l "I'm glad I haven't lectured you into a nap like Olly. What are you doing with Cursebreaking now?"
   
   "We spend the rest of the hour discussing our most recent assignments and Liam's health center work."
   
   "While didn't land on a project idea yet when we left the library, I'm sure we'll get to one soon by our next meeting."
