   "Olly is sleeping in a spot of sun, his tail curled up to his snout. I look down at my paper to see what ideas I have written down."
   
   "Two, three of them might be usable. Other than that, my small doodle of a pigeon sitting on a pumpkin isn't going to be much help."
   
   "I stretch my arms and look around. This particular library, Augury's Atrium, is reasonably full of other students."
   
   "Though there is some amount of chatter, the sounds are softened by the high ceiling and soft plush carpets."
   
   "If I listen closely, I can even hear the soft cooing and chirping of the birds that traditionally nest at the top of this library."
   
   "The school has been maintaining the nesting boxes for the birds since this library had been built, I heard."
   
   "That the singing of those birds relaxes many of the students studying here had just been an unintended, but happy side effect."
   
   l "Viola!"
   
   show l happy
   
   v happy "Over here!"
   
   "I move aside my bag from the chair next to me, and Liam slides in."

   l normal "Sorry about being late! There was just some clean up at the health center, and I had to run back to the dorm to get my things--"
   
   v normal "You don't have to apologize for that, Liam. I'm glad you got here."
   
   show l happy
   
   "Liam smiles, and runs his hand over the side of his head, flattening some tufts of hair that had gotten messed up from his run here."
   
   "I am glad. If I had to pick someone to be assigned with for a project, Liam would have been my first choice too."
   
   v "I did get some books we might want to use, but it might be better to talk together first?"
   
   v "Actually, I did want to ask. Can you tell me more about your major? I know some of the concepts, but that's a different beast than having experience with it."
   
   "Liam taps one of his hands against a book, and tips his head back."
   
   l "Right. You already know what Healing can't do?"
   
   v "Reverse death. Replace an irrevocably damaged organ. Permanently change the body's structure."
   
   #note later on will include something about healing and the emotion-based side 
   
   l "Yes. While Healing can speed up things that a body can already do, like the skin covering up a cut, or mending bone, there are limits."
   
   l "Healing...gives things a push. But it can't make the body do the impossible, like regrow a lost hand."
   
   v "Hmm. Is there a reason that most Healers start off working on familiars first?"
   
   "From Liam's phone, Clara has gotten herself out, and has started poking Olly's head with her paw."
   
   show cl normal at left
   
   l "There is. First, studying how magic flows through all kinds of familiars helps give us the broader eye we need for patients later on."
   
   l "Second. Familiars, just from the way they store magic, tend to be a little more durable than humans are."
   
   l "So, it's safer I suppose, for us to start with familiars while in training."
   
   show o normal at right
   
   "Olly, who had been napping, has started making grumbling sounds, and peeks open an eye at Clara."
   
   l "There's a lot more I need to study before we are allowed to even look at any human patients."
   
   v "Like what? Botany & Beasts, I suppose--and--"
   
   l "Summoning, yes. And Cursebreaking. Though in that area, I would bow to your expertise."
   
   show o happy at right
   
   "Olly jumps up, and snaps, teasingly, at Clara's paw without touching it." 
   
   "Clara jumps back, and bats a crumpled piece of paper at Olly." 
   
   hide o # Actually, it would be cute if we could figure out how to show sprites moving to different spots and define further-right and further-left locations for them to go.

   "Liam strokes down Clara's ears, and whispers something to her. Clara nods, and dissolves back into the phone."
   
   v "Shush, Olly. Look, you can nap now. Clara will wait til later and you two can play then."
   
   "Olly nods, slightly sulky, and settles down."
   
   v "All right. I think I got the bare bones explanation down. So what does Healing feel like, when you do it?"
   
   l "Hmm. It's like..."
   
   l "Imagine a mosaic. With a hundred--no, a thousand pieces, in all kinds of colors."
   
   l "Imagine that same mosaic with all its pieces scattered."
   
   l "In some areas of the mosaic, it's fine if one or two pieces are missing."
   
   l "In some areas, without the key pieces, the whole picture is lost."
   
   l "And you try to gather up those thousands of pieces, and put them back together. In the dark."
   
   l "I think...that's what it's like. Though I haven't worked on any really difficult cases yet."
   
   v "Wow. Something like that--"
   
   "I can see it in my mind's eye, the glass pieces scattering, jewel-bright ruby and sapphire and gold, and a careful hand trying to delicately place them, one by one, back together, without cutting their fingers on any of the sharp edges."
   
   l "Viola? Did that make sense? Or did I ramble for too long--?"
   
   v "No, no. You explained it very well."
   
   l happy "I'm glad I haven't lectured you into a nap like Olly. What are you doing with Cursebreaking now?"
   
   "We spend the rest of the hour discussing our most recent assignments and Liam's health center work."
   
   "While we didn't land on a project idea yet when we left the library, I'm sure we'll get to one soon by our next meeting."

   scene bg library
   
   "It's been a week. In between the rest of my classes, I've been doing my best to finish the books Liam and I checked out last time."
   
   "We still haven't hit on a project idea yet. But what information I have managed to read has been fascinating."
   
   "One book I skimmed follows the history of crystal miners who held strikes against the companies that used healers to magically take away their exhaustion and send them down the mines again for twenty hour shifts."
   
   "In the past, some jewels were favored for storing small bits of magic and were mined for that use. But they never could help as much as an animal familiar would."
   
   "Another book details possible substitutions for common healing herbs across other countries and climates. Gold spiceblossom from South America, for instance, has similar effects in healing to the fox-ear root from Finland."
   
   "I look over the table at Liam, to see if he just got any ideas in the last five minutes."
   
   show l normal
   
   l "This is a little more difficult than I expected."
   
   v normal "Yeah. I'm sorry. If I could only brainstorm on this faster, then we would be able to work on it sooner."
   
   l "Hey. What do you mean, if only you could think faster? I thought I was your project partner too."
   
   v "Oh! No, that's not what I meant. I know you are. It's just..."

   "I bite my lip. Liam's eyes have dark circles under them now, most days than not."
   
   "In between studying for his Healing classes, and his part time work at the health center, I know he has to deal with his own stress too."
   
   "I think I would just feel better if I could take on more of a lead on the responsibilities for the project. Give him less to worry about."
   
   s1 "Ashmark?"
   
   "I turn my head. It's another student, who just stopped by our table. They look vaguely familiar."
   
   "A classmate in Cursebreaking 101, I think. They sit...somewhere far behind me, so I haven't had the chance to talk to them much."
   
   v "Yes?"
   
   s1 "Is that book you're holding 'Corinne's Cursebreaking Cases: Volume 1'?"
   
   v "Yes. I'm not done with it though. Sorry, in case you were thinking of borrowing it."
   
   s1 "Oh. Nothing for it then. What's with those other books then? I didn't think we had a Healing portion on our next test."
   
   v "We don't. Liam here helped pick those out. We have a project that has something to do with Healing and Cursebreaking, after all."
   
   "The student's face, which up til this moment had been friendly, goes a little cold."
   
   s1 "Ah, Healing? That shouldn't be the hardest part of your project then."
   
   l "Healing, as a major, has a lot of branches and subfields going on. It's a bit more complicated than most people think."
   
   s1 "Please. Looking after sickly people or someone else's familiar--it's not really a dangerous field, is it?"
   
   s1 "Sometimes it sounds pretty cushy to me, compared to Cursebreaking. Isn't that right, Ashmark?"
   
   "My hands clench. Who does this person think they are?" 
   
   "I remember Liam, softly whispering to me in the library about his Healing classes, his eyes bright and excited."
   
   "The careful way he looks after the familiars in the health center."
   
   "All the times he worried over small animals who were injured, or even me, after I scraped my knees from running in the gardens"
   
   "or got a bruise from falling off a tree." 
   
   "Even if I didn't cry, Liam would cry sometimes, when treating me when we were small."
   
   "He would be quiet, but there would always be two or three tears that slipped down his face when he put a bandage on me."
   
   "The other student is still waiting for my response, with a bit of a smirk on their face, like they're expecting me to laugh along with their joke."

   "Certainly, there are already other basic curse sensors out there. But the one we want to create will be different."
   
   "Not only will it indicate whether a curse has taken effect or not, it will determine whether the curse is a location-based one or a personal one."

   "If they are suffering from any physical ailments from the curse, moving their locations is usually enough to mitigate the worst of the effects."

   #We probably don't need clothes descriptions once we have the sprites. #just wanted this detail in to emphasize that health center people usually wear some kind of uniform when working but it can be changed
   
   vv "Ah! Here it is. Liam said he was going to borrow this today, but he went right to the library after his shift."

   "This should be useful for our project."
   
   vv "Before you go, you want to help yourself to a snack?"

   vv "You'd be surprised at how many students come in with a sluggish familiar, and how much better they feel after a snack."

   vv "Hahaha. I suppose you're right, kiddo. Listen to me, soon I'll start reminiscing about the good old days, and yelling at you all to walk and not run over the grass."
   
   vv "Matter of fact, it wasn't too long ago since I started studying Healing here, but I guess I can't help feel a lot older, knowing I'm leaving next year."
   
   v "How did you choose Healing, anyways? I know some people...don't seem to respect the major very much."
   
   "I frown, remembering that confrontation Liam and I had with that other student in the library. I hope Liam isn't still bothered by it."
   
   "Valery looks at me, her eyes sharper, and tosses the emptied snack bag in her hand towards a trash can at the other end of the room. It lands in."
   
   vv "Those people are fools. But I can understand why some would think that. It's slow work. Not a lot of fame in it."
   
   vv "In the past, people either figured out what was wrong with their familiar on their own, or they had a family-assigned healer."
   
   vv "And preventing magical explosions from happening in the first place will never seem as exciting as jumping into the middle of one to stop it."
   
   vv "But regardless, I didn't choose to do this for the glamor. I chose this actually because I couldn't decide on one single thing."
   
   vv "I actually worked oh, about five different jobs before coming here. Sailor, landscaper, poker dealer--I've done a lot."
   
   vv "Out of all the majors, Healing had a bit of everything I was curious about. And everyone I've met before says I have a good touch with people."
   
   "Valery smiles, and taps on the wall near the clock."
   
   vv "Listen to me ramble on. I don't mind chatting all this time, but I do need to close up. Isn't Liam waiting for you?"

   "I can't imagine what would happen if our instrument was used in a healing center for example. It would be close to useless if it couldn't detect the difference between a healing spell and a casted curse."

   l "Not metal."
   
   v "What?"
   
   l "Metal has traditionally been used to break certain lower-level curses. It's fine if the aim is to break a curse, but not so much when we want to just detect it."

   "Today, surprisingly, is not a day for working out our project. Liam and I both attended two classes today after all, and are now walking together outside after I had ran into him."
   
   "There's still a tiny bit of light out, enough to see our paths by. Around us, other students chat about their Beasts and Botany homework, or complain about a moved rehearsal time for theater club."
   
   "We dodge around a huge line in front of one of the school's event halls. A few glowing posters float in mid-air, colorful and glittering, but it's hard to read them with the number of people lining up in front of it."

   "I tuck my hands into my pockets. Olly is taking a rest inside my phone. He has been working hard with me and Liam after all, with all our tests on our curse detector in progress." 
   
   "Professor Reynell from Cursebreaking class had agreed to look at our project notes too, early next week, to see if we were heading in the right direction. At our current pace, I'm fairly confident that Liam and I will have a decent project to turn in by the deadline."
   
   "I roll back my shoulders and sink my head lower into my scarf as a cold breeze sweeps by. My fingers play with the fringe a little--this is the same scarf that Liam had returned to me, not too long ago."
   
   "I hope he remembered to bring his gloves and scarf with him today too with these temperatures--with how busy he is, it wouldn't surprise me if things slipped from his mind every so often."
   
   "The bench I'm sitting on isn't too cozy. I consider whether I should head to one of the school cafes to get a drink when--"
   
   s1 "...you're considering him? Really? Liam from the health center?"
   
   s2 "You sound as if you've some objections. I have my reasons." 
   
   "My back stiffens. I only know one Liam who works at the health center. He hasn't mentioned any other students there that share his name. Why are they talking about him?"
   
   "The voice of the second student, that of a girl most likely, continues, sweet and light as sugar crystals falling into a glass--"
   
   s2 "Even if he isn't a first-choice pick, his looks are good enough." 
   
   s2 "In terms of money--true, it is a little lacking there. But my family is stable enough, and our company's investments in high-demand magical properties has bright prospects."
   
   s2 "In terms of magical ability, if I continue with my Healing major, we have enough similar knowledge to find things to talk about. We wouldn't bore each other."
   
   s1 "So my question is--for this Liam, you really like him?"
   
   s2 "Who knows? He's easy to get along with, when he's showing me how things work at the health center for my job. I wouldn't say no to going to the winter ball with him."
   
   s1 "Oh? So he's just an option you like out of convenience."
   
   s2 "You make me sound so cruel. Like I said, he's not my first-choice pick from the whole class, but he's nice enough to while away some time with."
   
   s2 "If there's a better option down the road, I can leave him then. Many fish in the sea, and all that."
    
   "There's an obvious, loud sound as I stand from the bench. Something clatters to the ground--my bookbag?" 
   
   "My teeth dig into my bottom lip. 'Not a first-choice pick?' 'She can leave him then?' Who could say such things? About Liam?"
   
   "From where I had turned around, I can't see much--though from the second student who had finished speaking, all I can see is a chignon of hair, tied off with a thin pale ribbon."
   
   s2 "Oh?"
   
   "The noise I made has made them turn around. The friend behind her at their table giggles, looking a little embarrassed." 
   
   s1 "I have an event to head off to Lottie! I hate to go, but I have to leave you here now."

   "Liam turns his head, fiddles with the lining of his hood."
