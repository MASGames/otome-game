   "Olly is sleeping in a spot of sun, his tail curled up to his snout. I look down at my paper to see what ideas I have written down."
   
   "Two, three of them might be usable. Besides that, my small doodles of a pigeon and a pumpkin isn't going to be much help."
   
   "I stretch my arms and look around. This particular library, Augury's Atrium, is reasonably full of other students."
   
   "Though there is some amount of chatter, the sounds are softened by the high ceiling and soft plush carpets."
   
   "If I listen closely, I can even hear the soft cooing of some of the birds that traditionally nest at the top of this library."
   
   "The school has been maintaining the nesting boxes for the birds since this library was founded, I heard."
   
   "That the singing of those birds relaxes many of the students studying here for exams had just been an unintended, but happy side effect."
