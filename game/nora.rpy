   # 3.?b Nora and Viola discuss potential projects 

   "I blink, having a hard time believing my luck, then turn to meet Nora's gaze. We share a grin."

   "This project is going to be a lot of fun, I can already tell--and it'll be really convenient to not even have to travel anywhere to meet up with my partner."

   "I hope Nora doesn't mind that the project will take time away from all her other projects, though."

   "It's hard, but I stay quiet as Professor Marquez finishes reading off the names. I do notice that Liam is paired with Colin--apparently convenient roommate group projects is our theme for today."

   "Shouhei's working with (TK random student), it sounds like. I'd like to be able to just ignore him completely, but it's difficult when he's right there."

   "Finally, Professor Marquez finishes reading out the names."

   pm "All right, now that that's over with, on to our topic for today."

   pm "I'm kidding! No need to look so betrayed, everyone." 

   pm "Go on, talk to your partners. Homework for next week is to bring in a couple of initial proposals to discuss. Class dismissed!"

   "I'm already halfway out of my seat by the time the professor finishes talking, and Nora and I meet in the middle."

   n "Rose garden?"

   v "That's a great idea."

   "We don't talk much on the way to the usual spot."

   "Once we get settled on our usual bench, Nora turns to me."

   n normal "So, partners, huh? Do you have any ideas for our project?"

   v normal "Honestly, not yet. Maybe we could do something based on one of your other projects, so you can spend your time on that too? I know they're important to you."

   n "That would be great! But I don't want to do something you won't enjoy. It's your project too, after all. And what we do has to involve more than just artificing."

   "I get a warm rush of happiness. Nora's really nice; I'm glad she's my partner instead of some stranger I barely know."

   "Which is funny, I guess, given that I've only known Nora for, what? Three months? But it seems longer, somehow."

   v "Okay, ideas ... what about an app for your familiar that can help break curses?"

   "Nora raises an eyebrow."

   n "I don't know about you, but I don't actually know that much about curses. Are they really that easy to break? Or to identify?"

   v "... Okay, no, not really."

   n happy "That was my guess, given how much trouble I've seen you have with cursebreaking homework."

   v happy "I feel like I should be insulted, but that's fair. Having something like that would be a big help with homework, though!"

   "I feel like I'm pretty good at cursebreaking, for a first year. But sometimes that means I end up dyed strange colors or hanging out on the ceiling for a few hours until I get everything straightened out. And Nora has a knack for coming in while I'm still in the middle of it."

   "So she's not wrong."

   "Nora sits back, leaning against her hands, and looks somewhat disgruntled."

   n "It would help if the professor had given us a more detailed description of what *kind* of project this is supposed to be."

   n "'A group project combining at least two kinds of magic' is the most vague description in the world! How are we supposed to figure out what they actually want to see?"

   "I make a face. She's not wrong about that, either. Although from what I've seen of the professor, I'm also ... not sure they care?"

   v "Maybe they just want to see what we come up with?"

   n "It's a class, it has to be graded somehow."

   v shrugging "Maybe we can ask them next class?"

   "That's going to be one thing about working with Nora--I've noticed she seems to care a lot more about her grades than I do."

   "Like, don't get me wrong, I want to do well, and I work hard to do it."

   "But when it comes down to it, grades are not the only or even the most important reason I'm here."
