   # 3.?b Nora and Viola discuss potential projects 

   "I blink, having a hard time believing my luck, then turn to meet Nora's gaze. We share a grin."

   "This project is going to be a lot of fun, I can already tell--and it'll be really convenient to not even have to travel anywhere to meet up with my partner."

   "I hope Nora doesn't mind that the project will take time away from all her other projects, though."

   "It's hard, but I stay quiet as Professor Marquez finishes reading off the names. I do notice that Liam is paired with Colin--apparently convenient roommate group projects is our theme for today."

   "Shouhei's working with (TK random student), it sounds like. I'd like to be able to just ignore him completely, but it's difficult when he's right there."

   "Finally, Professor Marquez finishes reading out the names."

   pm "All right, now that that's over with, on to our topic for today."

   pm "I'm kidding! No need to look so betrayed, everyone." 

   pm "Go on, talk to your partners. Homework for next week is to bring in a couple of initial proposals to discuss. Class dismissed!"

   "I'm already halfway out of my seat by the time the professor finishes talking, and Nora and I meet in the middle."

   n "Rose garden?"

   v "That's a great idea."

   "We don't talk much on the way to the usual spot."

   "Once we get settled on our usual bench, Nora turns to me."

   n normal "So, partners, huh? Do you have any ideas for our project?"

   v normal "Honestly, not yet. Maybe we could do something based on one of your other projects, so you can spend your time on that too? I know they're important to you."

   n "That would be great! But I don't want to do something you won't enjoy. It's your project too, after all. And what we do has to involve more than just artificing."
