   "Wyderwold University.  The premier applied magic college in the United States. Members of my family have attended for generations, and I've wanted to come, following in my sister's footsteps, since before I can remember."

   "Rumor has it that the school is afflicted with a very peculiar curse: that if you run across it, and you're lucky, you'll be marked for greatness, destined for a life of wealth and plenty."

   "If you're unlucky ..."

   "Well."

   "After what happened to my sister, to my whole family, I've wanted to come to this school even more."

   "So I can find the source of the curse, and end it. For good."

   v normal "That one's books--just put it on my desk for now, I'll unpack it later."

   "Well, here I am. After years of looking forward to this day, it's finally come: my first day of classes at Wyderwold University starts tomorrow." 
   
   "Which means that tonight is reserved for moving in." 
   
   "My parents dropped my stuff off at the entrance to the dorms, but they're too busy to stick around and help me move in properly, so we hugged at the entrance, they gave me the usual reminders to remember to make our family name proud, and left." 
   
   "Luckily for my back, on my second trip upstairs--because of course my dorm room is on the third floor--I ran into Liam, and he's been helping me move everything else up." 
   
   "Liam was one of my best friends when we were younger, but after…everything, my parents could no longer afford to retain his doctor mother's services, so he and his mothers had ended up having to move away." 
   
   "We'd kept in touch for a while, but we were also *twelve*; eventually we lost touch." 
   "Until a few weeks ago, when I'd received a message from him out of the blue, asking if I was still planning on attending Wyderwold, and mentioning that he'd managed to get in as well." 
   
   "(Back when we were younger, we'd all three planned to attend together. But then, well. That hadn't really worked out.)" 
   
   "We planned to both arrive at the same time, so we could help each other move in, but then my parents had a meeting that ran late, and there was a minor emergency of some sort, and--well, an on-time arrival just didn't happen." 
   
   l "I'm heading back downstairs for another load." 
   
   v happy "Thanks! Just--be careful if you grab the purple duffle bag, it's got some kinda fragile stuff inside." 
   
   l "Got it." 
   
   "Luckily, he doesn't seem to mind helping me out, even if I got here too late to return the favor. I should see if he'll let me buy him lunch sometime this week, as thanks."

Her side of the room is already set up: a computer on her desk with a large lamp looming over it; bed carefully made up with a comforter a lovely shade of light blue; wardrobe with one door left slightly ajar showing that it had been filled with clothes, and a stack of deconstructed cardboard boxes stacked up behind the trash cans." 
   
   "I'd be a bit worried that she'd think I was some sort of slob--I'm truly not, but I also don't always keep everything 100 percent straightened 100 percent of the time--except for the stack of small objects scattered over the rest of her desk, a few of which appeared to have spilled over onto her bed and the floor. A couple of them look like old smartphones, or pieces of them, but most of them I have no idea what they are, or what they're for."

I'm sure if recycling is exactly the right word, given that I also heard that that was where you were supposed to go to get materials to pack up for the summer, and it seems like a waste if they're going to end up breaking the boxes down at the beginning of the year just to reconstitute them into...more boxes, at the end of the year. But I didn't bother to enquire too deeply into the process; as far as I'm concerned, the boxes will be out of my dorm room and not my problem anymore, which is all I need to know."

   "But we're not kids anymore, a fact that is blatantly obvious just looking at Liam. He must be nearly a foot taller than me by now, and he has muscles! [TK more oh no he's hot??]"
